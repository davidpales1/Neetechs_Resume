    "description": "The idea of applying engineering concepts to medicine has been always fascinating to me. My research interest in cardiovascular fluid mechanics stems from their potential to provide accurate patient-specific diagnoses, prediction of surgical procedure outcomes, and application to a wide variety of biomedical problems. I have worked on projects that have the potential to improve human quality of life by conducting a non-invasive means to understand blood flow hemodynamics. Through these projects, I gained experience in 4D Flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). I mostly enjoy working on multidisciplinary projects, which led me to work with many collaborators to apply engineering concepts to clinical applications. "
